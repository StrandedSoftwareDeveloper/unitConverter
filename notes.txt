Load file into array of arrays
    Open file ✔
    For each line:
        If it starts with whitespace, it's a unit: ✔
            Find the first non-whitespace ✔
            Find the '=' ✔
            Everything inbetween is the name of the unit ✔
            Assert '*' ✔
            Find the '+' ✔
            Everything between the '*' and the '+' is the coefficient, parse as a double ✔
            The rest of the line after the '+' is the bias, parse as a double ✔
            Append to the current category ✔
        Else it's a category: ✔
            The entire line (without the newline) is the name, append to the array of categories ✔

Make "scrollableButtonList" struct
Make a scrollableButtonList of the outer array
When a category is selected:
    Make a scrollableButtonList of the corresponding inner array
    When a unit is selected:
        Show a text box for the number and a scrollableButtonList for each unit to convert to
        Future: When a unit is selected, switch to that unit
